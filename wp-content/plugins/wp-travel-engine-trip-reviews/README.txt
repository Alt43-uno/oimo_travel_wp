Trip Reviews is an extension for WP Travel Engine that allows a tour operator or a travel agency to add authentic trip reviews onto their website.

== Description ==

Trip Reviews extension adds a Trip Reviews sub-menu and a Review Tab on activation. Travel agency or tour operators (admins) can add reviews from both the Trip Reviews sub-menu and Review Tab, while travelers (users) can add reviews to the individual trips from the Review Tab in the frontend. Admin can later approve or unapprove the reviews.
